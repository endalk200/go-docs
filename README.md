# Learn Go

Go is a general purpose compiled language with advanced features and a clean syntax. Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles

The process we use to write software using Go (and most programming languages) is fairly straightforward:

- Gather requirements
- Find a solution
- Write source code to implement the solution
- Compile the source code into an executable
- Run and test the program to make sure it works

This process is iterative (meaning its done many times) and the steps usually overlap.
